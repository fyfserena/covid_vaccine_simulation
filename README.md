**Vaccine Allocation Simulation Under Covid-19** (IEOR 4404 Simulation, Prof Yi Zhang) 

**Aim**:

- Simulate a decision-making scenario (a government deciding who will get the COVID-19 vaccination first given a limited supply)
- Compare the performance of different vaccine-allocation policies

**Allocation Policies**

- Uniform policy (Unif):  vaccinate randomly
- Uniform Priority (UP): uniformly samples the people from each priority group based on the each group's susceptible number
- Strict Priority (SP): groups with higher priority get vaccination first
- Mixture Priority (MP): a modification to the SP policy by assigning vaccines to a mixture of groups during each periods
- Senior-first policy (pA): same procedure as (SP) but with prioritizing seniors first in grouping part**

**Priority groups:**
0: health workers
1: essential workers
2: seniors (age 65+)
3: others
